78xx/7905/LM317 models

To use those symbols and models do as you would for any model/symbol:
* Extract the .asy files to C:\Program Files\LTC\SWCADIII\LIB\SYM\
(a separate folder makes finding of symbols easy - the folder is already in the .zip file structure)
* Extract the .lib files to c:\Program Files\LTC\SwCadIII\LIB\SUB\
* Run SWCad III
* Have fun!


PS: In my Portuguese version of Windows , the LTC folder is C:\Arquivos de Programas\LTC\SwCadIII . So, there _may be_ some references to this, but they are only on the comments.



For now just hope it does not give "Timestep too small." (at least it seems to not give)

PS: sorry about my english. I am Brazilian.

Any problems, call me via e-mail, MSN or ICQ.
