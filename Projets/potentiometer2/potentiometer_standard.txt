A Collection Of Standard Potentiometers              Helmut Sennewald,  V1.1
 
A new symbol "potentiometer_standard.asy" has been generated for all the new potentiometers.
Put this file into the LTSPICE installation path lib\sym \... or into your working directory.
The file "potentiometer_standard.lib" contains the X-subcircuits of all the potentiometers.
There is a linear, log. and an arbitrary model. I have included the old model too.
Put the file "potentiometer_standard.lib" into the folder 
...\Progams\Ltc\SwCADIII\lib\sub
or into the directory where your schematic "potentiometer_standard_test.asc" is. 
 
potentiometer :  equivalent function to pot_lin, just the old symbol and model
pot_lin : ideal linear resistance dependency
pot_pow : ideal power function resistance dependency
pot_plog : ideal positive logarithm function resistance dependency
pot_nlog : ideal negative logarithm function resistance dependency
potr_tab: arbitrary(table) based resistance dependency
pot_piher_plog : pseudo logarithm function resistance dependency, Piher
pot_radiohm_plog : measured pseudo logarithm fucntion resistance dependency, Radiohm

LTSPICE have to be restarted before the new symbol can be used.

The pot_pow, pot_plog and pot_nlog  potentiometers need an additional reference value.
This reference value pair specifies the slope of the ratio.
Rtap: resistance at the refrence point
Tap: position of the wiper at resistance Rtap

How to select the model?
Move the cursor over the potentiometer then click the right mouse button. 
Then the the model name and the parameters can be changed. 
The model file has to be loaded with a  .include potentiometer_standard.lib 
statement to the schematic.

*     RTOT = total resistance
*     WIPER = ratio of travel of the wiper
*     RTAP = reference resistance at wiper=Tap
*            It is needed only for pot_plog, pot_nlog and pot_pow.
*            RTAP is measured between pin-2 and wiper.
*     TAP = ratio of travel when Rtap is reached
